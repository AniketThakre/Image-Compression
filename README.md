**Image Compression (JPEG / PNG)**

This project has endpoints created for image compression in springboot.

Here, I have created 3 end-points, first to upload the file to the server. Second to process the image and compress them and the third one to download the compressed file.

We can call all three endpoints in a single call (In sequence).

**Point to Enhancement**

Can add extra parameter to compress the JPEG image by user defined margin (from 0.1x to 0.9x).
